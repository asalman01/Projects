Hello there. 

This was a project that I had made for my web page development class. It uses a mixture of HTML, JS and CSS!

I made this project with the idea of being in a tech company, and followed a rubric my professor had uploaded. Generally, most pages haven't been made despite having links, but I may update this in the future. 

Hope you like it!
